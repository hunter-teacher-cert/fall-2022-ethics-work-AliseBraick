# Current Algorithm

* Economy plus passengers get to choose their seats
* Economy passengers are assigned randome seats
* No pripority for family to be seated together. Kids might be seated away from both parents
* Kids might end up seating at the exit

# Suggested Algorithm

## All passngers should allow to choose their seats
### The seating map should indicate 
* Seats reserved for people with disabilities
* Block of seats reserved for families of more than two,  with extra $$$$)
* Twin seats for a child and one parent (assigned automatically )
* Exit area
* Back seats_last row_Cheaper/passengers might be given some $$ incentive)
* Seats with extra leg room (extra $$$$)

### I have read that some airlines allow passengers to purchase an exgtra seat for 20 dollars if the flight is not full. The airline usually informs the passengers 48 hours in advance. If the flight gets full, they will refund them.
