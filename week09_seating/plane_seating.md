# Plane Seating Algorithm 
### Contributors: Alise Braick, Benjamin Eckley

* The Airplane Seating program asks the user for the seat they would like to reserve.
* layout of the plane is printed and an X is placed in the reserved seat. Cols A and A are windows, Ciols B and C are Aisle.
* The program finds if the seat is available and if the entry is valid.  An input of 'q' ends the program.
  

### Our Difficulty
After a lot of difficulty we decided to go with an algorithm that went back to the days
when reserving a seat on an airplane actually counted for something and overbooked flights
didn't exist!

Obviously the algorithm we wanted to produce was beyond our coding prowess. After many
attempts we ended up finding a simple plane reservation code in Java and did our best
to translate it into Python.

### Things we could NOT account for accessibility wise:
* Although families can choose their own seats, there is a possibility that no more twin seats are left
* People in need of special seating for physical disabilities
